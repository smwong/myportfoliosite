  <div class="point1"><h3>Currently:</h3></div>
  <div class="item1"><p>I work full time presently as a graphic designer and image editor for a local photography company. It started out as a small family-run business about 40 years ago, and has since grown into a state-wide operation. Part of my job is to help them find ways to update their branding for the digital age we live in. So far, I've used drag-and-drop programs like MailChimp ad SquareSpace to create HTML templates, but I would love to be able to have more control of overall design by learning web development.</p></div>
